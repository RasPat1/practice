===================

Repo of classic (and not so classic) problems that i've never acutally sat down and coded. 


Graphs
------
 * AdjList repr of graph
 * BFS
 * DFS
 * Dijkstra
 * Bellman-Ford


Search
------
 * Binary Search
 * Insertion Sort
 * Shell Sort
 * Selection Sort
 * quick Sort
 * mergeSort
 * heapSort
 * Find Median
 * Find kth statistic


Data strutctures
----------------
 * Binary Search Tree
 * Linked List
 * Graph
 * Heap


Misc
----
 * Longest increasing subsequence
 * Sqrt using successive approximation
 * Number of paths through a grid
 * Tree Traversals
 * List Flattenings
 * Tree to Heap conversions and Vice Versa
 * Find the first ten digit prime nuber in the decimal expansion of e
